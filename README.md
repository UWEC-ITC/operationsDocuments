# operationsDocuments
This is meant to be a store of documents and references for the ITC commission.

### Keeping track of Projects
We're going to be keeping track of projects on Trello. The idea is to have a main board for
all the ideas then individual boards for each project. This will help organize the high level status of each project while having detailed boards for each project.

### Keeping track of Documents
Open and honest storage is important for the operation of the ITC. This is done through GitHub which allows for a timeline of changes to the documents. Each project on the Trello board will have a link to a corresponding project folder in `./projects` directory.
